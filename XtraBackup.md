XtraBackup is a free, GPL-licensed "hot backup" tool that is designed to take online backups of MySQL tables that use the InnoDB storage engine.

It applies a similar methodology to the commercially available InnoDB Hot Backup, which was originally developed as by InnoBase, the original developers behind the InnoDB storage engine.

XtraBackup is developed and maintained by Percona, however, it is open to community contributions.

You can find out more about contribution at the [XtraBackup Launchpad Page](https://launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup).
